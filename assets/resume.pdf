# Resume Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the actual resume PDF file.

In a real implementation, this would be a PDF file containing:
- Contact information
- Professional summary
- Work experience
- Education
- Skills
- Projects
- Certifications

To add an actual resume:
1. Create or export your resume as a PDF
2. Replace this placeholder file with your actual resume.pdf
3. Ensure the file path matches the download link in the HTML
